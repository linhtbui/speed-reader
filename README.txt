5. Analysis of results:
   Overall, the speed-reader program (using focus letters) succeeded in
   allowing for increased comprehension of articles at lower reading
   speeds. However, articles read at higher reading speeds (350-500 WPM)
   resulted in lower comprehension quiz scores among all three
   participants. Comprehension was somewhat maintained between articles
   read with and without the speed-reader program, albeit mainly for those
   read at 350 WPM or below.
